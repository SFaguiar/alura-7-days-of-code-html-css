# Alura #7DaysOfCode in HTML and CSS
 A repository where my progress in the #7DaysOfCode HTML and CSS challenge is saved. The scope of the challenge is "an IT company wants to develop a page aimed at new hires and hired you to develop it."

## Day 1 (done in 29.12.2023)
 "On the first day, you will be presented with the layout of a page in Figma, analyze it and use it to create your page header, which contains a logo, links to other pages and some buttons."

 "On this first day, you will develop the application header, normally called Navbar, which includes the logo, the menu with the pages and also the two buttons in the right corner."

## Day 2 (done in 30.12.2023)
 "Here you will develop the second section of the page, which is 'About us', something very basic and present on most business pages. In this section, you will have different pieces of text, each with a different size, color, and alignment."
 
 "Today's challenge is to develop the first section of your page, which can also be called the 'header'."

## Day 3 (done in 02.01.2023)
 "On that day you will need to work a lot with alignment in CSS, and knowledge of Flexbox or Grid will make your life a lot easier! The section is called 'Metrics and Results' and contains 4 text blocks side by side, each with different blocks inside."

 "Continuing, today you will develop a really cool and challenging part: the metrics and results section of your page. It is a very common section on most landing pages we see nowadays.

 The company that hired you asked you to include 4 different metrics, with a title, a subtitle and text:"

## Day 4 (done in 02.01.2023)
 "The time has come to play with images, many people's nightmare! In this section, you will have some parts of text and an illustrative image that will have to be aligned correctly. The use of responsive measures is something that can help you a lot."

 "What you're going to do today is the "We're looking for talent" section, but without the job advertising part yet, just up to the image!"

## Day 5 (done in 02.01.2023)
 "This will probably be the most challenging day, as you will develop the 'Jobs' section of the page, which contains different groups of blocks grouped together and various information about open positions."

 "Continuing, today you will develop perhaps the most important part of the entire project, the vacancies section!"

## Day 6 (done in 03.01.2024)
 "Reaching almost the end, you will develop the 'Testimonials' section, which will involve knowledge of changing background color, font size and alignment of text and images."

 "In today's challenge, you will create the Testimonials section. This section will contain a small text above, a title, an image of a collaborator, as well as her name and position within the company."

## Day 7
 "On the seventh and final day of the challenge, you will create the bottommost part of the page: the footer. But it's not just any footer, it contains, among other things, an email registration form with a pre-defined value and also a button, both perfectly aligned. You will close with a flourish!"
