# Alura #7DaysOfCode in HTML and CSS
 A repository where my progress in the #7DaysOfCode HTML and CSS challenge is saved. The scope of the challenge is "an IT company wants to develop a page aimed at new hires and hired you to develop it."

## Day 1 (done in 29.12.2023)
 "On the first day, you will be presented with the layout of a page in Figma, analyze it and use it to create your page header, which contains a logo, links to other pages and some buttons."

 "On this first day, you will develop the application header, normally called Navbar, which includes the logo, the menu with the pages and also the two buttons in the right corner."

## Day 2
 "Here you will develop the second section of the page, which is 'About us', something very basic and present on most business pages. In this section, you will have different pieces of text, each with a different size, color, and alignment."
 
## Day 3
 "On that day you will need to work a lot with alignment in CSS, and knowledge of Flexbox or Grid will make your life a lot easier! The section is called 'Metrics and Results' and contains 4 text blocks side by side, each with different blocks inside."

## Day 4
 "The time has come to play with images, many people's nightmare! In this section, you will have some parts of text and an illustrative image that will have to be aligned correctly. The use of responsive measures is something that can help you a lot."

## Day 5
 "This will probably be the most challenging day, as you will develop the 'Jobs' section of the page, which contains different groups of blocks grouped together and various information about open positions."

## Day 6
 "Reaching almost the end, you will develop the 'Testimonials' section, which will involve knowledge of changing background color, font size and alignment of text and images."

## Day 7
 "On the seventh and final day of the challenge, you will create the bottommost part of the page: the footer. But it's not just any footer, it contains, among other things, an email registration form with a pre-defined value and also a button, both perfectly aligned. You will close with a flourish!"
